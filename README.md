# Prisma API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Prisma/api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Prisma/api)

## About

Prisma is an app that strengthens the relationship between people with memory loss and the people close to them. It does this by providing a living, collaborative digital photo album that can be populated with content of interest to these people.

This repository hosts the central API for the project.

## History

Project Prisma was part of [Open Knowledge Belgium](https://www.openknowledge.be/)'s [open Summer of Code 2017](http://2017.summerofcode.be/). A student team coached by Frederik Vincx [(@fritsbits)](https://github.com/fritsbits) worked on it in July 2017:

* Michiel Leyman ([@MichielLeyman](https://github.com/MichielLeyman)) - backend & project management
* Simon Westerlinck ([@siimonco](https://github.com/siimonco)) - backend & database modelling
* Jean-Pacifique Mboynincungu ([@oxnoctisxo](https://github.com/oxnoctisxo)) - frontend system analysis
* Thor Galle ([@th0rgall](https://github.com/th0rgall)) - frontend & product owner

The app was conceived in a one-month collaborative design project in a care home in Zonhoven, Belgium, in January 2017. Together with personel and dementia design researchers the team honed in on a static prototype that was later refined during the Open Summer of Code. More info about it in [this blog post](http://www.frederikvincx.com/project-prisma-helping-people-with-dementia/).

First, peruse the [Prisma wiki](https://github.com/Prisma/documentation/wiki) to learn about the roadmap, milestones and approach to developing software for people with dementia.

## Installation

Requires PHP version `>=5.6.4`.
Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed.

After cloning, install project dependencies:  
```bash
composer install
```

Generate an app key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

We use MySQL, you can add settings for your local database configuration in a `.env` file ([see example](https://github.com/Prisma/api/blob/develop/.env.example)). All other configuration that is specific to your local environment should also be set in this file.

Run database migrations and seed:
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

Serve the application:  
```bash
php artisan serve
```

Run API tests:  
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Feature
```  
This uses the `testing` environment, so make sure you have a `.env.testing` file for all configuration specific to running the tests (such as a separate database).
